# Data Science in R

## 🤓 Course overview and learning outcomes 

This course will walk you through how to create and deploy your very own data science package in R.

## :octocat: R and Rstudio

R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, …) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. 
The R language is often the vehicle of choice for research in statistical methodology, and R provides an Open Source route to participation in that activity.
One of R’s strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality plots can be produced, including mathematical symbols and formulae where needed. Great care has been taken over the defaults for the minor design choices in graphics, 
but the user retains full control.

## :octocat: Getting Set up with R 

R is a free and open source language. If you do not have R installed, you can install R and R studio at the following links:

["R"](https://cran.rstudio.com/)

["R-studio"](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)


## Components of an R package

### DESCRIPTION
The package description file is a base file used to store crucial information required to utilize the package's contents.
Information listed includes name, authors, version, encoding, and dependencies. If you use additional packages within your
created package, be sure to list them under imports and use the following syntax when referring to them in code (package_name::function()).
However, it is inefficient to load in large packages when only using a few of the functions, so only use additional packages when absolutely
necessary and avoid using large statistical method/ml packages.

### man folder
This folder is generated by a built in package formatted called ROxygen. The folder contains .Rd files that are used to create the documentation for
each function. You can find these help pages by typing ?function_name in the RStudio console.

### NAMESPACE
Namespace is the linking file between the packages contents and the user interaction with the package. Function names and types are listed in
this file. A default NAMESPACE is generated by RStudio when creating a package, but we would like ROxygen to create a new one for us. We can do this
by deleting the original NAMESPACE file and then running "devtools::document()" in the RStudio console.

### R folder
This folder will contain the functions of the package. Be sure to properly label these functions using ROxygen comments, indicated by #'

### .Rproj
This file is how will access the project before it has been deployed. By selecting file->open project, you can open the in development package
by clicking on this file.

### tests folder
Generated by the use_testthat() function from the "usethis" package, the tests folder will contain test files to ensure your functions are 
running as specified.


## 📝 Required Next Stpes
* Create your own .R file containing a function to be added to the team package.
* Be sure to include all of the required elements, including param, return, and examples.
* Add you name to the authors list of the description, and include any packages used in imports.
* Add a "test that" file and write at least one passing test for your function.

## 📝 Optional next steps 

* Watch the R package tutorial.
