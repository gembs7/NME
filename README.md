# Data Science in R

## ü§ì Course overview and learning outcomes 

This course will walk you through how to create and deploy your very own data science package in R.

## :octocat: R and Rstudio

R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, ‚Ä¶) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. 
The R language is often the vehicle of choice for research in statistical methodology, and R provides an Open Source route to participation in that activity.
One of R‚Äôs strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality plots can be produced, including mathematical symbols and formulae where needed. Great care has been taken over the defaults for the minor design choices in graphics, 
but the user retains full control.

## :octocat: Getting Set up with R 

R is a free and open source language. If you do not have R installed, you can install R and R studio at the following links:

["R"](https://cran.rstudio.com/)
["R-studio"](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)


## üìù Required Next Stpes
* Create your own .R file containing a function to be added to the team package.
* Be sure to include all of the required elements, including param, return, and examples.
* Add you name to the authors list of the description, and include any packages used in imports.
* Add a "test that" file and write at least one passing test for your function.

## üìù Optional next steps 

* Watch the R package tutorial.
